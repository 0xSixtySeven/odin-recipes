    <h2>Small Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Kimi-Matias Räikkönen (born 17 October 1979), nicknamed "Iceman", is a Finnish racing driver currently driving
        in Formula One for Alfa Romeo Racing, racing under the Finnish flag. He won the 2007 Formula One World
        Championship in his first season with Scuderia Ferrari. After nine seasons racing in Formula One, he competed in
        the World Rally Championship in 2010 and 2011, then returning to Formula One from 2012. In addition to this
        title, Räikkönen also finished second overall in 2003 and 2005, and third in 2008, 2012 and 2018. Räikkönen
        entered Formula One as a regular driver for Sauber-Petronas in 2001. Having previously only raced in very junior
        open-wheel categories, he was given his Super Licence from the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)
        after a performance delivery promise by his team boss, Peter Sauber. He joined McLaren Mercedes in 2002, and
        became a title contender by finishing runner-up in the 2003 and 2005 championships to Michael Schumacher and
        Fernando Alonso, respectively. Räikkönen's 2002, 2004 and 2006 seasons were plagued by severe unreliability from
        his McLaren cars. Räikkönen switched to Ferrari in 2007, becoming the highest-paid driver in motor sport with an
        estimated wage of $51 million per year. In turn his move to Ferrari saw him secure his first Formula One World
        Drivers' Championship, beating McLaren drivers Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso by one point, as well as
        becoming one of the very few drivers to win in their first season at Ferrari. In 2008, he equalled the record
        for fastest laps in a season for the second time. After one more year in the sport, he left the Ferrari F1 team
        to drive a Citroën C4 WRC for the Citroën Junior Team in the World Rally Championship for 2010. Along with
        rallying, Räikkönen has turned his attention towards NASCAR, and made his debut for Kyle Busch Motorsports in
        the Camping World Truck Series. He also made a return to racing in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, driving for RWR
        in 2011 and for Joe Nemechek in 2012. On 29 November 2011 it
